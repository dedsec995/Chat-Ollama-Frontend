# Chat-Ollama-Frontend

This is the frontend application for a real-time chat system built with React. It communicates with a backend built using Flask, which handles the chat messages, conversations, and file uploads. The frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to send messages, upload files (like CSV), and view responses.

### Features
- Real-time chat: Send and receive messages in real-time.
- Conversation management: View and switch between different chat conversations.
- File uploads: Upload CSV files as part of the conversation.
- Responsive UI: A clean and responsive interface for desktop and mobile.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that the following are installed on your machine:
- Node.js
- npm

### Installation
Follow the steps below to set up the frontend:
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-frontend-react.git
cd chat-frontend-react
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the dev server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## End Note:
Feel free to take the source code and use it as you like. It is a boiler plated code to start your own chat app powered by llm. Do check out the [backend](https://github.com/dedsec995/Chat-Ollama-Backend) for this project.
Give it a star if you liked it!!
